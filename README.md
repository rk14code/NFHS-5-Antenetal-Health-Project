# Socioeconomic Determinants of Antenatal Care Utilization in India: An NFHS-Based Analysis

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

This project investigates the **socioeconomic factors influencing antenatal care (ANC) utilization** among women in India using data from the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)**. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and policy insights.

## 📌 Objective

To identify and quantify the **key socioeconomic and demographic determinants** affecting the likelihood of Indian women receiving adequate antenatal care (at least 4 visits as per WHO guidelines).

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [NFHS-5 (2019-21)](https://mohfw.gov.in/sites/default/files/NFHS-5_Phase-II_0.pdf)
- **Target Group**: Women aged 15–49 who gave birth in the last 5 years.
- **Sample Size**: 172,702 respondents after cleaning.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- **Missing values**: Handled with median/mode imputation and logical replacement.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Z-score, IQR, and capping applied.
- **Encoding**:
  - Ordinal: Label Encoding (e.g., education, wealth index)
  - Nominal: One-Hot Encoding (e.g., religion, caste, region)
- **Scaling**: Standardization (Z-score)
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using SMOTE
- **Feature Selection**: Based on correlation, domain knowledge

## 🔍 Feature Importance

- **Top Predictors**: Region > Religion > Caste > Residence > Age
- Regional disparities dominate ANC utilization. Women in Nagaland, Bihar, and UP were significantly more likely to **miss ANC visits**.

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- **Education** and **wealth** significantly improve ANC utilization.
- **Rural women** and those from disadvantaged **caste/religion groups** face access barriers.
- **Region** emerged as the strongest determinant.
